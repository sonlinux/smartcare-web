Quick Project Setup
-------------------

Refer to `project setup guide`_ for in depth information.

Make sure docker is installed, and project
already opened using PyCharm. Then run these command:


Quick Installation Guide
------------------------
For deployment I use `docker`_ so you need to have docker
running on the host. smartcare is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

    git clone git://github.com/sonlinux/smartcare.git

    cd /project/root/dir/deployment

    make build

    make permissions

    make web

    make run

    # Wait a few seconds for the DB to start before to do the next command

    make migrate

    make collectstatic

    # You can access the project in two ways

    1. Via web server nginx by going to address in the web browser  

    >> http://0.0.0.0:60209/site-admin

    2. By setting up the local development server with Pycharm and this will
     expose the address. See instructions on setting up with pycharm locally
      in the README-dev.md file

      >> http://0.0.0.0:60206/site-admin



So as to create your admin account:
```
make superuser
```
